# Conversational-AI-Chatbot
A conversing chatbot built from Microsoft's DialoGPT language model.
This chatbot takes in user voice input from the microphone, feeds it to the model, 
gets back a response, which it outputs through the speaker.
As such, the conversation feels real and interactive, instead of passive.
